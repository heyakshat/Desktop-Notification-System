# Desktop-Notification-System
Desktop Notification System Project In Python 
This will display a notification with the title "My Notification" and the message "This is my notification message!". The app_name parameter sets the name of the application that is shown as the source of the notification, and the timeout parameter specifies how long the notification will be displayed before automatically closing.

You can customize the notification further by specifying additional parameters, such as the app_icon parameter to set an icon for the notification.

Note that the plyer library is not included with Python by default, so you'll need to install it using pip:

Copy code
pip install plyer
Also, the behavior of notifications might vary on different platforms, so be sure to test your notification system on all target platforms.
